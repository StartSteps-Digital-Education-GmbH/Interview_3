### Abstract
Below is the complete solution for the car garage management system that incorporates Kadane's Algorithm to analyze the parking effects of currently parked cars. The solution includes the class definition, methods for parking and unparking cars, and the implementation of Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum contiguous sum of parking effects.

### Complete Solution

```typescript
class Garage {
    private capacity: number; // Maximum capacity of the garage
    private parkedCars: Set<string>; // Set to store parked car IDs
    private parkingEffects: { [key: string]: number }; // Map to store parking effects for each car

    constructor(capacity: number) {
        this.capacity = capacity; // Initialize capacity
        this.parkedCars = new Set(); // Initialize the set of parked cars
        this.parkingEffects = {}; // Initialize parking effects map
    }

    // Method to park a car with a specific parking effect
    park(carId: string, effect: number): boolean {
        // Check if the garage is full or if the car is already parked
        if (this.parkedCars.size >= this.capacity || this.parkedCars.has(carId)) {
            return false; // Cannot park the car
        }
        this.parkedCars.add(carId); // Park the car
        this.parkingEffects[carId] = effect; // Store the parking effect for the car
        return true; // Successfully parked
    }

    // Method to unpark a car
    unpark(carId: string): boolean {
        // Check if the car is currently parked
        if (!this.parkedCars.has(carId)) {
            return false; // Cannot unpark the car
        }
        delete this.parkingEffects[carId]; // Remove the parking effect
        this.parkedCars.delete(carId); // Unpark the car
        return true; // Successfully unparked
    }

    // Method to get the list of parked cars and apply Kadane's Algorithm
    getParkedCars(): { parkedCars: string[], maxEffect: number } {
        const parkedCarsArray = Array.from(this.parkedCars); // Get the current state of parked cars
        const effects = parkedCarsArray.map(carId => this.parkingEffects[carId]); // Get the parking effects

        // Apply Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum sum of contiguous parking effects
        const maxEffect = this.maxParkingEffect(effects);

        return { parkedCars: parkedCarsArray, maxEffect }; // Return both parked cars and max effect
    }

    // Method to find the maximum parking effect using Kadane's Algorithm
    private maxParkingEffect(effects: number[]): number {
        if (effects.length === 0) return 0; // Handle empty input

        let maxSum = effects[0]; // Initialize maxSum with the first element
        let currentSum = effects[0]; // Initialize currentSum with the first element

        for (let i = 1; i < effects.length; i++) {
            currentSum = Math.max(effects[i], currentSum + effects[i]); // Update currentSum
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum); // Update maxSum
        }

        return maxSum; // Return the maximum sum found
    }
}

// Example Usage
const garage = new Garage(5);
console.log(garage.park("CAR001", 3)); // Output: true
console.log(garage.park("CAR002", -1)); // Output: true
console.log(garage.park("CAR003", 2)); // Output: true
console.log(garage.park("CAR004", 5)); // Output: true
console.log(garage.park("CAR005", -3)); // Output: true

// Get the current state of parked cars and the maximum parking effect
const { parkedCars, maxEffect } = garage.getParkedCars();
console.log("Currently parked cars:", parkedCars); // Output: ["CAR001", "CAR002", "CAR003", "CAR004", "CAR005"]
console.log("Maximum parking effect:", maxEffect); // Output: 8 (from the subarray [3, -1, 2, 5])
```

### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Class Definition**: The `Garage` class is defined with properties for capacity, parked cars, and parking effects.

2. **Parking a Car**: The `park` method allows a car to be parked if there is space available and the car is not already parked. It also stores the parking effect associated with the car.

3. **Unparking a Car**: The `unpark` method removes a car from the garage and deletes its associated parking effect.

4. **Getting Parked Cars**: The `getParkedCars` method retrieves the current state of parked cars and their parking effects. It applies Kadane's Algorithm to calculate the maximum contiguous sum of parking effects.

5. **Kadane's Algorithm**: The `maxParkingEffect` method implements Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum sum of contiguous parking effects from the array of effects.

### Example Input and Output

**Input:**
- Parked Cars with Effects:
  - CAR001: Effect = 3
  - CAR002: Effect = -1
  - CAR003: Effect = 2
  - CAR004: Effect = 5
  - CAR005: Effect = -3

**Method Call:**
- `getParkedCars()`

**Output:**
- Currently parked cars: `["CAR001", "CAR002", "CAR003", "CAR004", "CAR005"]`
- Maximum parking effect: `8` (from the contiguous subarray [3, -1, 2, 5])

### Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The `park` and `unpark` methods operate in O(1) time complexity.
   - The `getParkedCars` method uses Kadane's Algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of parked cars.

   Overall, the time complexity of the entire solution is O(n).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of parked cars, due to the use of a `Set` to store the car IDs and a map for parking effects.

### Conclusion

This complete solution effectively manages the parking of cars in a garage while utilizing Kadane's Algorithm to analyze the parking effects. It provides a clear and efficient way to determine the maximum contiguous sum of parking effects, optimizing resource management in a dynamic environment.

### Scenario in an Interview

1. **Initial Problem Statement**: The interviewer presents the problem of managing a car garage, explaining that the candidate needs to implement a system to park and unpark cars, and to return the list of currently parked cars.

2. **Ambiguity in Requirements**: The interviewer may mention that the system should also analyze the parking effects of the cars but does not specify how this analysis should be performed or what metrics are important. For instance, they might say, "You should also consider the effects of parking on the overall capacity," without detailing what "effects" means.

3. **Candidate's Understanding**: The candidate might interpret the requirement to simply return the list of parked cars without considering any additional analysis. They may focus on implementing the basic functionality of parking and unparking cars, missing the opportunity to apply a more complex analysis like Kadane's Algorithm.

4. **Lack of Clarifying Questions**: If the candidate does not ask clarifying questions about what "analyzing parking effects" entails, they may miss the chance to demonstrate their understanding of how to apply algorithms to enhance the solution. For example, they could ask:
   - "What specific metrics should we analyze regarding parking effects?"
   - "Are we looking for a maximum contiguous sum of parking effects, or is there another analysis you have in mind?"

5. **Interview Outcome**: If the candidate submits a solution that meets the basic requirements but does not incorporate the analysis of parking effects, the interviewer may view this as a missed opportunity to demonstrate deeper problem-solving skills. The candidate may receive feedback indicating that they could have enhanced their solution by applying Kadane's Algorithm to analyze the parking effects.

### Importance of Clarification

- **Understanding Requirements**: Clarifying requirements is crucial in software development and interviews. It ensures that the candidate fully understands the problem and can provide a solution that meets the expectations of the interviewer.

- **Demonstrating Problem-Solving Skills**: By asking clarifying questions, candidates can showcase their analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. It allows them to explore different approaches and demonstrate their ability to apply algorithms effectively.

- **Avoiding Miscommunication**: Misunderstandings can lead to solutions that do not align with the interviewer's expectations. Clarifying questions help bridge the gap between what is assumed and what is actually required.
